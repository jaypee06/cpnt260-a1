    <h2>BASKETBALL</h2>
    <article>
        <h3>WHAT</h3>
        <p>
         The <em>history of basketball</em> began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield,
         Massachusetts by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than 
         football. Naismith was a 31-year old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors
         during the winters.[1] The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed,
         first in America and then in other parts of the world. After basketball became established in American colleges, 
         the professional game followed. The American National Basketball Association (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a
         multibillion-dollar enterprise by the end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American culture.

    <h5>WHY</h5>
    <p>
         In December 1891, college teacher <strong>James Naismith</strong> had a problem.
         His students, forced indoors because of winter, had become rowdy. 
         They had a lot of energy, but no way to burn it off. It was too cold to play football and baseball, 
         and too dangerous to play those sports in the gym.

        <h4>WHO</h4>
<p>
    The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, 
    Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months. Naismith was a physical education instructor at YMCA
     International Training School (now known as Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Upon the request of his boss, 
     Naismith was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in cold weather.[1] It consisted of peach 
     baskets and a soccer style ball. He published 13 rules for the new game. He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine 
     players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game. The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the 
     fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony. Every time a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could
     bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed. The first public basketball 
     game was played in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1892
